This project is a simple, responsive web-based calculator built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.It performs basic arithmetic operations including addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.The application is designed with a clean user interface and supports both mouse interaction and keyboard input for improved usability.
The calculator dynamically updates the display as users enter numbers and operators.It prevents invalid input such as multiple consecutive operators or duplicate decimal points within a number.The calculate() function evaluates expressions safely and handles errors like division by zero by displaying an “Error” message.Additional features include delete(DEL),clear(C) and keyboard shortcuts such as Enter for calculation,Backspace for delete and Escape for reset.
The layout uses CSS Grid for structured button alignment and responsive styling.Overall,this project demonstrates DOM manipulation,event handling,input validation and basic expression evaluation in JavaScript.
